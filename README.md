# NET CAT

<h1>Description<h1>

This project consists on recreating the NetCat in a Server-Client Architecture that can run in a server mode on a specified port listening for incoming connections, and it can be used in client mode, trying to connect to a specified port and transmitting information to the server.

    NetCat, nc system command, is a command-line utility that reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP. It is used for anything involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets, it is able to open TCP connections, send UDP packages, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports and many more.

    To see more information about NetCat inspect the manual man nc.
